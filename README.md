# react-native-maps-project

Repository was created to explore React Native and the react-native-maps library. I have been researching mobile development technologies and have really enjoyed working with React Native. The application currently plots all the state capitals in the United States and demonstrates how to manipulate geographic points on a map. The mobile app uses some UI Components from React Native Elements.

The project was development using Expo development tools, which I've found extremely helpful. I would recommend downloading the Expo XDE and Expo Mobile Client to assist you in development. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Software you'll need to run the project

```
Expo
node.js or yarn
react-native-elements
A mobile device or use https://snack.expo.io/
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
git clone https://github.com/jasonrberney/react-native-maps-project
cd react-native-maps-project
yarn install
```

Open the project in Expo XDE or add it to a snack (https://snack.expo.io/)
